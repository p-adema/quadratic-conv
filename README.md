## Experiments

The virtual environment is managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
and can be initialised with `uv sync`.
However, a working Python enviroment with PyTorch
and typical packages installed will likely work.

Experiments must be run with the project root as working directory, e.g.

``python src/experiments/plot_tropical_convs.py``
